====Introduction

- How to unit test class that depends on external resources
- Unit tests should not touch external resources
- if it does, that is an integration test
- test the logic in a class while excluding dependency on external resources
- principle
    - have a video service class that uses File class, uses Dbcontext class
    - extneral reousrce
    - to unit test, need to do surgery to decouple VideoService from File class, DbContext class
    - this way when unit test, can replace File class with another class that doesn't do anything
    - fake/test double - class that doesn't do anything, replaces the dependent class
    - how to do that surgery??

===Loosely-coupled and Testable Code

- Most legacy applications are built without unit testing... 
- in order to unit test, have to refactor towards testable, Loosely coupled design
- loosely coupled design is one where you can replace objects with another at run time
- Object talk to external resources
- can replace with test double
- 3 Steps
- 1. Extract code/logic that uses an external resource into a separate class
    - isolate from rest of code
- 2. Extract an interface from that code (a contract)
    - simply tell that another class implements that contract   
    - IFileReader -> FileReader / FakeFileReader
- 3. Modify the class under test to use the interface instead of concrete implementation
    - will depend on interface only
- now class is loosely coupled and tested
- In practice that means we should remove instances in the code where we use the new operator
- Example
public void MyMethod()
{
    // when you use new you are making your class tightly coupled to a given implementation
    // no way to replace with a fake object
    var reader = new FileReader(); // should remove this!!
    reader.Read();
}

// one way to do this is to pass in the dependecy as a parameter to the method
// or in the constructor via dependency injection
public void MyMethod(IFileReader reader)
{
    reader.Read();
}

not can provide a different implementation

Production code - real implementation
Test code - fake implementation

dependency injection - we inject dependency from the outside
    - inject / supply dependency from the outside
    - now class is loosely coupled and testable

==Mocking Frameworks
    - use these to setup your mocks/fake/stubs so each time you run time you can set the state that you need objects in
    - Different Frameworks
        - **Moq, NSubstitute, FakeItEasy, Rhino Mocks, - is the prefered one
        - Need to add Moq to unit testing project
