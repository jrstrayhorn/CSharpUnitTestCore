Fundamentals of Unit Testing

====Characteristics of good unit tests
- First-class citizens
    - as important as production code
- should be clean, readable, maintainable
    - each test should have a single responsibility
    - each test should be no more than 10 lines of code
    - fails because test are large, fat and messy
    - spend too much time debugging test
    - refactor as necessary
- No logic
    - no if, else, foreach
    - no conditional logic or loops
    - why? when you have logic could make a mistake
    - have a bug in test instead of production
    - just call method and test assertion
- Isolated
    - each test runs like its the only test in the world
    - should not call other methods or assume state from another test
- Not too specific/general
    - too general - no confidence

====What to Test and What Not to Test
- if don't know what to test, probably have untestable code
- if methods are too fat, doing too many things, again tough to test
- Unit Testing and Clean Code go hand in hand
    - Testable Code is clean
    - Clean code is Testable
    - properly structured
- Test the outcome of a function/method
- Query vs Command
- Query
    - return some value
    - test should verify that returns the right value
    - if method has multiple execution paths, you should test all of those paths
        and make sure each path returns the right values
- Command
    - does an action
    - changes state, calls web service, connects to database
    - send a message to message queue
    - these methods are making a change in the system
    - these might return a value as well
    - example: 
        method creates a new order object, 
        saves to database,
        returns new order object with unique id
    - should test the outcome of the method
    - if object state has changed, should test that object state has changed correctly
    - if outcome is to an external resource, should verify that the right call is being made to external dependency
- What NOT to test
    - Language features
        - example: DTOs w/ just properties shouldn't be tested
        - like C#
    - 3rd-party code
        - Don't write tests for Entity framework
        - Dapper
        - just test your code!!

====Naming and Organizing Tests
- Test Projects
    - TestNinja
    - TestNinja.UnitTests (run fast locally)
    - TestNinja.IntegrationTests (run just before code commit)
- Test class for each class in code because
    - Reservation
    - ReservationTests
- Test methods
    - Number of Tests >= Number of Execution paths
    - name of tests should clearly state the business logic being tested
- Bad Tests
    - Test1, SavecustomerTest
- Test methods
    - MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior
    - should be able to look at the name of a test and tell what business rule is being tested
- if method is really complicated, with lots of execution paths MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior
    - it might be best to have a separate class for the method
    - other wise tests might pollute test class
- Reservation_CanBeCancelledByTests (class with all testMethods for CanBeCancelled method)
or Reservation (folder) / CanBeCancelledByTests (class w/ testMethods)
